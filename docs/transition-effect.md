# Transition Effect

The Creative Slider Block allows you to customize the transition effects between slides. Each effect comes with additional controls to further personalize the slider's behavior and appearance.

## Choosing a Transition Effect

- Select the Creative Slider Block. In the *Settings* sidebar, find the dropdown menu labeled **Transition Effect**.
- Select a Transition Effect:

	- Slide: The default sliding effect where slides move horizontally or vertically.
	- Fade: The slides crossfade from one to the next.
	- Creative: Offers advanced transformation effects for the next and previous slides as they enter and exit the active state.

## Configuring the Creative Transition Effect

When the **Creative** effect is selected, you can create unique transitions for the **Next** and **Previous** slides:

	- Next: Configures the transformations applied to the next slide (the slide that appears after the current one). This slide will transition from the defined settings to the normal slide view as it becomes the active slide.
	- Previous: Configures the transformations applied to the previous slide (the slide that appears before the current one). This slide will transition out according to the settings youâ€™ve defined in the Previous tab.

Above the Next and Previous tabs, a dropdown menu provides a set of pre-configured options that automatically apply specific transformations to the next and previous slides.
